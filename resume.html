											<h3>About Me</h3>
											<p>I really enjoy exploring the intersection of the arts and computer science. My journey as a creator began in my basement, where I would choreograph short dance combinations. I strung together different movements, feeling the music around me. As I got older the music began to shift. As I sat facing a screen, the soundtrack from computer games began to surround me. I found myself immersed in a whole new world of technology and innovation. Soon enough, I was creating Flash games, sketching out an asteroid and coding gameplay mechanics for my own Star Wars-inspired game. This newfound passion for technology intertwined seamlessly with my love for creation, igniting a lifelong curiosity. </p>
											<p> I just graduated from Vassar College with a major in Computer Science and a correlate (minor) in Mathemathics. I studied abroad at the University of York, where I studied Interactive Media. Outside of class, I was the Vice-Chair for the Computer Science Majors Committee. I focused on engagement by creating a social media prescence and gaining 100 followers in one semester, organizing fun and unique events, and enhancing professor and student relationships with entertaining initiatives. I was the president of Coalesce Dance Ensemble, a collabortive, audition-based dance organization as well as the vice chair of the Computer Science Major's Committee. I was a Quadball (formerly Quidditch) captain and the Treasurer of Coalesce Dance Ensemble. I was also a Daisy Chain where I helped raise money and plan events for seniors during my sophmore year. During my junior year fall, I was the assistant Event Manager for the Computer Science Major's Committee. I have also worked at Vassar College's Reunion, where I faciltated alumni relations. I additionally was an orientation leader where I led a homeroom for a group of 20 first-year students. In this homeroom, I faciltated presentations on tough subjects, like consent, overdose prevention, and wellness.</p>
