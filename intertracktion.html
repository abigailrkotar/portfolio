							<h2>InterTracktion: User Experience</h2>
						</header>
						<p>After visiting the National Railway Museum in York, I was tasked with making the museum more interactive. The museum features incredible trains, but there is little movement or information on the trains. In Figma, I designed a mobile application that used Augmented Reality to explore the trains. I analyzed exisiting user data and then conducted usability research to develop a final prototype. </p>
                        <h2  >Demo</h2>
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAbxlLExgg4?si=EUOYcaZOUs5KGVns" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <h2  >Research</h2>
                        <p>The National Railway Museum provided us access to their data from their survey. While reviewing this data, there were a few common trends I noticed.</p>
                        <img src="images/customer_response.png" alt="Improvement: would love to do a treasure type hunt. May be something special about the trains that everyone could get involved that takes you around the whole site." width="1000">
                        <p>As seen above, this user requests a treasure hunt along with other vistors who requested a more interactive experience for all ages. During my visit, I started playing Pokemon Go, which inspired me to create an Augmented Reality based mobile application that acts like a treasure-hunt through all the trains.</p>

                        <h2  >User Journey</h2>
                        <p>Based on the National Railway Museum's data and their focus on accessibility and inclusion, I created two personas. </p>
                        <img src="images/persona1.png" alt="user persona of Hugh, who is a young boy in a wheelchair. he loves trains and cannot wait to visit the National Railway Museum." width="50%">
                        <img src="images/persona2.png" alt="user persona of Gloria, who is a middle age mom who wants to enjoy a fun experience for the whole family" width="50%">
                        <p>My primary persona is Hugh, who is a train lover! He cannot climb into old trains due to his wheelchair but craves a way to interact with the trains.</p>
                        <img src="images/user_journeymap.png" alt="user journey map of Hugh going through negatives that the app could solve" width="1000">

                        <h2  >Wireframing</h2>
                        <p>I then started designing the wireframes to include features that my personas and user research reflected. </p>
                        <img src="images/iphone-wireframe.png" alt="black and white image of an iphone with the Augmented Reality panel" height="500">
                        <p>Based on my functional and non-functional requirements, I designed wireframes like the model above in Balsamiq. </p>
                        <h2  >Prototype</h2>
                        <p>I started designing the prototype based on the wireframes and the National Railway Museum's color palette on their website.</p>
                        <img src="images/design_process.png" alt="three iphone screens next to each other showcasing the changes throughout the design process" width="1000">
                        <p>I went through mutiple iterations and then completed usability testing, which lead me to alter a few more features.</p>
