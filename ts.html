											<h2>Using Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis to Analyze Taylor Swift's Lyrical Progression</h2>

										<h3>Abstract</h3>
										<p>Over the trajectory of her career, Taylor Swift
											has taken the world by storm. Using this
											Swift’s lyrics to compute a sentiment analysis with TextBlob, VADER, and Flair as well as
											topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, this project will explore how her musical
											themes changed in relation to her success as an
											artist. As a whole, Swift’s music shifts away
											from romantic relationships to more complex
											themes.</p>
										<h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
										<p>Overall, sentiment analysis was not going to capture the nuance and artistic quality of lyrics. TextBlob is a lexicon based tool, which assigns
											each word a value between -1 and 1, -1 being the most negative and 1 being the most positive. This will not get any nuance, as seen by the graph. 
											It ranked all albums somewhat positive, but surprisingly 1989 was the lowest. </p>
										<p>VADER uses a lexicon and rule based approach, where a rule based approach assings different tags to words. VADER is trained on social media data, which also 
											does not truly capture the essence of Swift's lyrics. VADER also ranks 1989 the "saddest" album. Both TextBlob and VADER do not seem to capture how humans 
											would rank Swift's albums due to the limits of a lexicon based approach. 
										</p>
										<p>
											Lastly, Flair uses a deep-learning approach to try and capture more context when determining sentiment. As seen in the graph, it shows a more negative descent thorughout
											Swift's music. This is more accurate based on a human impression. evermore and Midnights are the most negative, which from a human perspective is the most accurate. 
											Therefore, Flair's sentiment analysis seems to be the most accurate. 
										</p>
										<h3>Topic Modeling</h3>
										<p>I choose latent direchlet allocation for topic modeling, as it is available in the gensim library in Python.
											For topic modeling, LDA lets the user choose
											the number of categories. After a few trial runs
											with between 2 and 7 categories, 4 categories seem
											to lead to the lowest perplexity scores and the best
											human comprehension. I removed all filler words like "the," "and," etc. from the data set in order
											to make the categories the most comprehensisable.
										</p>
										<p>Overall, the topic modeling by album did showcase a shift in Swift's lyrics over time. Her themes became more complex and less simple.
											In her inital albums, they showcased clear cut categories with young love or breakup. However, in her more recent albums Swift's categories
											became more complex with themes like darker love, painful love, growing up, and a senusal love. These themes evolved as Swift grew up and shifted genres.
